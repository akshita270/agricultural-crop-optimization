# üåæ Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning üåæ

## **Project Overview**

This project recommends the best-suited **crop for cultivation** based on various **environmental parameters**. By analyzing features like **soil pH**, **rainfall**, and **temperature**, it determines the optimal crop for specific conditions. Initially using basic machine learning models, the project has been extended with **deep learning techniques** to enhance prediction accuracy.

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes the following features:

- **N**: Nitrogen content in the soil
- **P**: Potassium content in the soil
- **pH**: Soil pH level
- **Rainfall**: Amount of precipitation
- **Temperature**: Average temperature
- **Crop**: The recommended crop (target variable)

## **Models Used**

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Achieved **98% accuracy** üèÜ
4. **Deep Learning Model** - Enhanced version with **additional feature engineering** for better predictions

## **Results**

- **98% accuracy** using **SVM**.
- Implemented **deep learning techniques** for **improved predictions**.
- Visualized feature relationships with a **correlation heatmap**.
- Evaluated model performance with **visualizations**:
   - **Heatmaps**
   - **Feature importance plots**
   - **Model evaluation metrics**

## **Visualization**

- **Heatmaps** to analyze feature correlations.
- **Feature importance plots** to highlight key predictors.
- **Evaluation metrics** to assess model performance.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add more **environmental factors** such as **humidity** and **soil nutrients**.
- **Deploy the model** as a web application for **user-friendly crop recommendations** üå±.
