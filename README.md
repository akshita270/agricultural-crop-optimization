Crop Recommendation using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to recommend the best-suited crop for cultivation based on various environmental parameters. The dataset includes features like soil pH, rainfall, and temperature. The project initially used basic machine learning models and has been extended with deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

Dataset

The dataset contains:
N: Nitrogen

P: Potassium

pH: Soil pH level

Rainfall: Amount of precipitation

Temperature: Average temperature

Crop: Target variable representing the recommended crop

Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Highest accuracy: 98%)

Deep Learning Model (Enhanced version with additional feature engineering)

Results

Achieved 98% accuracy using SVM.

Implemented deep learning techniques for better predictions.

Correlation heatmap visualized feature relationships.

Visualization

Heatmaps

Feature importance plots

Model evaluation metrics

Future Enhancements

Include more environmental factors like humidity and soil nutrients.

Deploy as a web application for user-friendly recommendations.
